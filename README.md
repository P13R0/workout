This is a Progressive Web App that allows you to create workout tables.

...work in progress...

Mir√≤ [dashboard](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOZA8pKk=/) that I use to model the project.

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Apache Maven** to manage dependencies
- **Kotlin** as language (a fancy Java based on JVM)
- **Vert.x**, toolkit based on JVM and used to implement
  asynchronous and event driven structures. Read this [article](https://dev.to/cherrychain/introduction-to-vert-x-37nb) for more details.
- **JUnit 5** to test the code with TDD
- **MongoDB** to store data

### Frontend
- **Vue** as framework
- **Ionic** as UI
